Serializing and deserializing a tree  =>
Use preorder traversal (root, left, right) to serialize and deserialize it accordingly.



- To solve trees problems focus on a particular node how it can contribute to solution and 
  let recursion rest of the things.


- Full Binary Tree => In which every node has two children
- Complete BT => When level order traversal is done, No empty elements in mid traversals.
- Perfect BT => No empty elems in level order traversal not even in end.


-----------------MERGING TWO BST'S----------------------

- We can merge two bst's by inserting each value from one tree into another in O(n1*log(n2))
- Other way is  O(n1+n2)
	- Flattening the tree into sorted array using InOrder O(n1+n2)
	- Merge two sorted array into one o(n1+n2)
	- Use recursion to convert a sorted array into BST.  O(n1+n2)






---------------Convert a BT into BST without disturbing structure------------

- Get the inorder trav of BT into arr and sort this array.
- Perform Inorder trav on BT and trav on arr simaltaneously and replace the data of each node.
