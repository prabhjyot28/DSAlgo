Dp problems has two properties 
1)  Overlapping problem = Dynamic Programming is mainly used when solutions
    of same subproblems are needed again and again.


2)  Optimal Substructure =  if optimal solution of the given problem can be 
    obtained by using optimal solutions of its subproblems.


Typically, all the problems that require to maximize or minimize 
certain quantity or counting problems that say to count the arrangements 
under certain condition or certain probability problems can be solved by 
using Dynamic Programming.
