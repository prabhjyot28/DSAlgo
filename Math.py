# If a number n is not a prime, it can be factored into two factors a and b:
# n = a * b
# If both a and b were greater than the square root of n, then a * b would be greater than n. 
# So at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of n, 
# and if we can't find any factors less than or equal to the square root, n must be prime.
