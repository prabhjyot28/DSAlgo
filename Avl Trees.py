# Balanced Binary search trees are those having guraanted height of O(logn)

#AVL Tree is one of type of BBST.
# Balance Factor (root ) = Height of right tree  - Height of left tree.
# AVL trees balance themselves by rotation.
#
# Inserting into an AVL tree.
# Removal is similar to BST. (find the node and replace it with its scucessor).


# Red Black trees is also kind of BBST.
# Node is either red or black.
# Root and (Nill Nodes) are always black.
# If a node is red then its children are black.
# All paths from a node to its nill descendants conatins same number of black nodes.
# The longest path (root to farthest Nil) is no more than twice the length of shortest path.(root to nearest Nil)
